The Jaccard Index is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how similar two sets are. The Jaccard index of two identical sets is 1. If two sets do not have a common element, the Jaccard index is 0. The Jaccard is calculated by dividing the size of the intersection of two sets by the union of the two sets.
To compare two shows by the Jaccard index, we build two sets that “represents” categories of the two shows.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommend items that are similar to those that a user is viewing, rated highly or purchased previously.

Collaborative-Filtering: Use the preferences, ratings and actions of other users in the network to find items to recommend.

Cosine index calculate the similarity between two vectors. The value of this index fluctuates between -1 and 1. If the returned value is -1 it means that the two vectors are totally different, while if the return value is 1 the two vectors are very close to each other.
To compare two users by the Cosine index, we build two vector that “represents” the users.
