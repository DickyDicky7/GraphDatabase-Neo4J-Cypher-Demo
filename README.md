## Jaccard Similarity Index

The Jaccard Similarity Index is a measure of the similarity between two sets of data. Developed by Paul Jaccard, the index ranges from 0 to 1. The closer to 1, the more similar the two sets of data. If two datasets share the exact same members, their Jaccard Similarity Index will be 1.
